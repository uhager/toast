Toast displays TACTIC (http://tactic.triumf.ca/) events online and offline. It can connect directly to the analyzer via socket, or read analyzed data from file.
It visualizes tracks and coincidences, and generates energy and position histograms. It is also possible to apply cuts to data.
Load the example .toast data file for testing.
